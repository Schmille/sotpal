## Some of these people are lying
Sotpal (**s**ome **o**f **t**hese **p**eople **a**re **l**ying) is a small program inspired by the excellent YouTube 
series [Two of these people are lying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UAOs9B9UH8&list=PLfx61sxf1Yz2I-c7eMRk9wBUUDCJkU7H0)
by [The technical difficulties](https://www.youtube.com/techdif).

Basically, three (or more) people select a random wikipedia article and do not tell each other about them.
Then a player randomly selects one of the articles and asks questions about it to the other player, who all have to 
pretend that the selected article is theirs. One of them will be telling the truth, the others will pretend like they know
what the're on about.

**Note:** This project was rigged together quickly for my personal entertainment. Should you want to use it, 
feel free to do so. You may however also want to check out the alternatives posted below for a (possibly) less annoying
experience.
